# Godot Plotting Experiment

## Overview
A Godot project in alpha whose goal is to bring the power of graphing to Godot. It started out as a jam project,
but I ended up spending more time on trying to plot then actually making a game. Right now, this code can
only draw and transition between functions (defined with `FuncRef`)
